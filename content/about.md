I founded [OpenFab](https://openfab.be) in 2012, a fablab in Brussels where people come to build things they can't build alone. Over the past decade, that role has taught me more about governance, community dynamics, and shared infrastructure than any book could.

Before fablabs, I worked in operation systems engineering. The transition sounds dramatic, but the patterns rhyme: distributed systems, protocol design, fault tolerance. The scale changed; the thinking didn't.

This portfolio is an experiment in making knowledge visible. Every post here is backed by timestamped documentation — what I call *blocks*. Patterns emerge when enough blocks accumulate in the same direction. Confidence scores reflect evidence density, not self-assessment.

I believe the best way to demonstrate skill is to show the work, not to talk about it. That's what this site attempts to do.
